# Fees

Participants in the Vega network who place orders on the order book, provide liquidity and run the network infrastructure receive the fees that traders pay on filled trades and transfers. The protocol does not charge gas fees for interacting with the network.

You can offset some of those fees, or earn even more, by receiving discounts or getting rewards based on trading activity. Rewards can be funded by anyone, and can be in any asset. See the rewards that are currently available on [vega.xyz ↗](https://vega.xyz/rewards).

[Concept: Discounts and rewards](https://docs.vega.xyz/mainnet/concepts/trading-on-vega/discounts-rewards)

At the time of writing the current fees for taker trades is 0.045% across all markets. This breaks down as:

- 0.03% Infrastructure Fee
- 0.01% Liquidity Provider Fee
- 0.005% Maker Fee

The meaning of each is covered [here](../trading-on-vega/fees.md). The Infrastructure and Maker fees are set by governance at a network level and the Liquidity Provider Fee is set dynamically by the liquidity providers for a given market, however at time of writing all are at a 0.01% level.
