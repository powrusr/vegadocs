# Token Economics

The VEGA token is an ERC-20 token used for staking and platform governance, allowing holders to take part in the creation and maintenance of markets alongside various other protocol level configurations. The token itself is not necessary for trading, and all fees paid for trading on the network are paid in the traded asset.

# Token Details

The token address is [0xcB84d72e61e383767C4DFEb2d8ff7f4FB89abc6e](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcB84d72e61e383767C4DFEb2d8ff7f4FB89abc6e) 

# Staking

Held tokens can be staked to validators once associated to a key on the Vega protocol network in order to receive a portion of infrastructure fee revenue. This can be completed using the front-end at [https://token.vega.xyz/validators](https://token.vega.xyz/validators) and further information on staking can be found [here](https://docs.vega.xyz/mainnet/concepts/vega-chain/proof-of-stake)

# Governance

Once staked, VEGA tokens also allow holders to vote on proposals on the Vega network itself, along with proposing their own changes. These proposals range from changing network parameters to proposing entirely new markets. 

Active proposals can be found at [https://token.vega.xyz/proposals](https://token.vega.xyz/proposals) whilst a more in-depth guide to the various governance options can be found at [https://docs.vega.xyz/mainnet/concepts/governance](https://docs.vega.xyz/mainnet/concepts/governance).
