The Vega protocol software is built to provide a framework for creating markets for trading financial instruments that are based on the values of their underlying assets. All markets created using the Vega protocol have been initiated and voted on by tokenholders. To start, the Vega protocol supports creating cash-settled futures and perpetuals markets. ([Learn about cash settlement on Investopedia. ↗](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashsettlement.asp))

Participants that interact with a derivatives market created using Vega software can submit market, limit, pegged, and iceberg orders, and use stop orders to manage their positions.

The topics in this section are in progress and will continue to cover more of the trading framework.

:::info Try it out
This section covers derivatives trading concepts and parameters that can impact trading modes. If you understand basics and want to try out the Vega protocol for trading, use [Vega Console ↗](https://console.fairground.wtf) for the Fairground network. You'll need to deposit testnet assets using Vega and Ethereum wallets.
