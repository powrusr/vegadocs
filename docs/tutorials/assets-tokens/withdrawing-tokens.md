## WIP

How to withdraw your VEGA tokens depends on the status of the tokens.

- search for your public key here. You'll see a breakdown of the tokens for that key and their status.

If your tokens are unstaked, unlocked -- standard route. 

If your tokens are vested, 
- not sure? check here if they're vesting, and details about tranche they're in
- tokens that are vested ?, then disassociate if they're staked (gov dapp)
- redeem  (transfer it to the general account?)
b. If you're staked through bridge, as in your tokens are in your ethereum wallet, do this
- disassociate (gov dapp)
