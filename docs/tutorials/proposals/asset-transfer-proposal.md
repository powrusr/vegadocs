Certain network-managed accounts require the community to approve transferring assets out of them. 

This tutorial describes what you need to propose transferring assets from those network-managed accounts to other accounts, and provides proposal templates that you will need to edit before submitting.

## Requirements

You will need:
* A connected [Vega wallet](../../tools/vega-wallet/index.md), with your wallet name and public key to hand
* A minimum of whichever is larger, associated with that public key: <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.transfer.minProposerBalance" hideValue={true}/> (<NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.transfer.minProposerBalance" hideName={true} formatter="governanceToken" suffix="tokens"/>) or <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="spam.protection.proposal.min.tokens" hideValue={true}/> (<NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="spam.protection.proposal.min.tokens" hideName={true} formatter="governanceToken"  formatter="governanceToken" suffix="tokens"/>)
* Familiarity with how [proposing an asset transfer](../../concepts/governance.md#propose-an-asset-transfer) works

## Anatomy of an asset transfer proposal [WIP]
Read on for the key inputs to a governance-initiated parameter proposal.

The contents of a `changes` object specifies what will be different after the proposal. In this case, this is the accounts that assets will move to/from, how much, and when.

**Rationale** requires a title and a description. They are free-text fields that describe the purpose of the proposal. Within the description, include links with more information about your proposal (such as to the IPFS content or forum post) that voters can reference to learn more about the proposal.

**????** is the name of the ???.

**????** is the ????.

"governance.proposal.transfer.maxFraction"
governance.proposal.transfer.maxAmount

governance.proposal.transfer.minClose
governance.proposal.transfer.maxClose

governance.proposal.transfer.maxEnact
governance.proposal.transfer.minEnact

## Templates and submitting
In the tabs below you'll see:

* Annotated example describing what each field is for
* JSON example that can be submitted with the [governance dApp â†—](https://governance.fairground.wtf/proposals/propose/raw)
* Command line examples for different operating systems

**Replace the example data with the relevant details before submitting.**

## Voting
All proposals are voted on by the community. To vote, community members need, at a minimum, the larger of <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.transfer.minVoterBalance" suffix="tokens" hideName={true} formatter="governanceToken" />, or <NetworkParameter formatter="governanceToken" frontMatter={frontMatter} param="spam.protection.voting.min.tokens" suffix="tokens" hideName={true} /> associated with their Vega key. 

Your proposal will need [participation](../../concepts/governance.md#how-a-proposals-outcome-is-calculated) of <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.transfer.requiredParticipation" formatter="percent" hideName={true} /> and a majority of <NetworkParameter frontMatter={frontMatter} param="governance.proposal.transfer.requiredMajority" formatter="percent" hideName={true} />, so having community support is essential.

Proposers who invite feedback, engage with comments, and make revisions to meet the needs of the community are more likely to be successful.

## Enactment
If successful, the proposal will be enacted at the time you specify in the `enactmentTimestamp` field.
