The Vega protocol software is built to provide a framework for creating markets for trading financial instruments that are based on the values of their underlying assets. All markets created using the Vega protocol have been initiated and voted on by tokenholders.

Currently, the Vega protocol supports creating the following cash-settled products:
* futures markets
* perpetual futures markets

[Learn about cash settlement on Investopedia. ↗](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashsettlement.asp)

Participants that interact with a market created using Vega software can submit market, limit, pegged orders. They can also act as market makers in exchange for a portion of the fees by submitting the liquidity commitment transaction and fulfilling the requirements associated with it.
